# Sonic World Release 9
Blitz Sonic Engine code

THIS IS A CODE OF SONIC WORLD ENGINE RELEASE 9

## Assets
This repository ONLY includes the code for the game. Assets will need to be retrieved from a compiled version of Sonic World Release 9.
The game assets are encrypted using Molebox, so you need [De-Mole-ition](https://lifeinhex.com/updated-molebox-unpacker/), to extract the assets contained in GameArchive.swarc.
The extracted folders should all be placed in the game's main directory (i.e. Characters should be in the same folder as Mods, and _SourceCode)
